# Grade-Calculator
Simple grade calculator hacked together for personal use. See ReadMe.txt for more info. 

Grades need to be added manually as a list (e.g. all quiz grades for the semester so far).

calc_final_grade will be called and take a list, how much weight the grade is worth, and if any "X" lowest scores are dropped.
